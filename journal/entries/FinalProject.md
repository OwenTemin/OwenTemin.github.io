# Final Project
This code is a simple calculator program written in C++ that allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. To make this program work, I had to learn how to use the iostream library for standard input and output, as well as how to write functions for each operation. I also learned about using loops for repeated user input (like in the addition and subtraction functions), implementing a switch statement to handle the user's menu choice, and returning values from functions. Additionally, I had to understand how to work with variables, user prompts, and capturing user input using cin. Debugging this program helped me recognize the importance of handling integer division and remainders, and also made me aware of the need to use the correct data types for arithmetic results. Overall, this project helped me build foundational skills in C++ programming, function design, user interaction, and control flow.
