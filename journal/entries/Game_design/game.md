# Shooty-Shooty Game

This Game will be clicker/shooter game Kind of like an aim trainer. Randomly targets will apear, and you have to click on them to kill them. When you succefully click on a target, you get +1 to your score, with the goal of getting as High a score as possible. To lose there will be a timer counting down from 30, or you miss a certain amount of targets in a row and you lose.The player will interact with this by clicking on the targets. In my MVP there will be randomly spawning targets, and a shooting mechanic.
